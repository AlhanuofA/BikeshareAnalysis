# BikeshareAnalysis

In this project, Python is used to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. 
You will perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. 
You will also make use of a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help you visualize the data.
